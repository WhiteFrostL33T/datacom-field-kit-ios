# Datacom Field Kit — Field Kit Web

The Datacom Field Kit as a universal web app for **Android and iOS**.
Installable, works offline, no account, no cloud — all data lives in the
browser on the device (localStorage).

**Current version:** v2.5

This repo is now the single home of the app. The standalone Android APK
is retired (v2.3 was the last APK build); all new work ships here.

## Install

- **iPhone:** open the URL in Safari → Share → Add to Home Screen.
- **Android:** open the URL in Chrome → menu (⋮) → Install app
  (or Add to Home screen).

## How it works

- `index.html` — the entire app in one file: project hub, time tracker
  (timers + manual entries), cable pull, camera storage, PoE budget,
  subnet/IP planner, port log, materials log, and the always-on final
  materials log.
- `manifest.json`, `sw.js`, `icon-192.png`, `icon-512.png` —
  PWA install support plus an offline service worker (page is always
  fetched fresh when online, cached copy is the offline fallback).
- `apple-touch-icon.png`, `logo.png` — home-screen icon and branding
  (keystone data jack).
- Backups: the in-app Backup section exports all data as JSON and can
  restore it; each project card can also export/import individually
  (`fieldkit-*.json`), which is the easiest way to move a job between
  devices.

## Changelog

- **v2.5** — footer now reads "Field Kit Web".
- **v2.4** — backup/project imports accept `.txt` files; `.json`
  downloads keep the right file type on Android.
- **v2.3** — version number shown in the footer.
- **v2.2** — spacing fix: Import button no longer touches the top
  project card.
- **v2.1** — Import Project is a toggle button like + New Project.
- **v2.0** — import a project from a `fieldkit-*.json` export
  (merges everything; re-import creates a copy); time entry notes
  field wraps and grows as you type.
- **v1.9** — projects sort newest-first; per-project Export button
  (self-contained JSON).
- **v1.8** — removed the preset quick picks; "Your picks" learns
  from what you type.
- **v1.7** — removed the locked Final materials log row from the
  module toggles.

  materials log; export moved there; personal quick picks.

  export leads with project name + ConnectWise #; cable footage
  grouped by cable type.
- **v1.4** — "Run label" renamed to "Cable type".
